Hi! Welcome to my 3D portfolio. This portfolio is a summary of my other site (as shown below) and is more lighthearted in nature, showing more about my hobbies/interests. 

Did you spot some of the artifacts lying around?

<br />1. The keyboard

<br />A near exact replica of my own keyboard!

<br />2. T1
<br />![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df5d1e07-39ae-4af3-a38d-3b2e5a6b403e)
<br />I've been a long time League of Legends player since 2011 (Season 1) and an equally long time fan of T1 (or SK Telecom T1 2 as it then was) since it's formation in 2013. 

<br />3. Yoasobi

<br />My favorite artist (and song as shown in the music video playing on the screens)

<br />4. Totoro "Plush"
<br />![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6406f468-b3b9-44c9-b10d-f30ba276e7ce)
<br />An iconic part of my small desk that always finds it way into the corner of my pictures when I draw.

<br />5. Peppy
<br />![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/609b19d1-ed8f-4aa4-906e-5b58c34be00f)
<br />Peppy from Honkai Star Rail (all credits to Hoyoverse for his design). The cute little dog that's on my phone case:)
Extremely big fan of Hoyo's games having played HI3, Genshin, HSR and ZZZ.

<br />6. 1971 Singapore Topo Map
<br />![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e6da30f-6c39-4426-a9e7-46491d915af3)
<br />A homage to my prior experience in Military Intelligence and a openly published example on some of the end products I used to work on (although my specialisation lies in operations and orthoimage maps rather than topographical)
